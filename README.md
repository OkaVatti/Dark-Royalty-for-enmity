# Zelk for Enmity

This is a theme for iOS Enmity Discord with dark/blue-greenish colors. I didn't make this theme, just adapted it for Enmity.

## How to install

1. Go into Enmity (Discord) settings
2. Click Themes
3. Click the plus icon
4. Paste the following link in the text box

Yes, I do realize the channel name is illegible, that isn't my fault as Discord on PC/Mac doesn't have this issue as the channel text changes color to another value. No I will not change the normal text color as I tried to match Zelk as much as possible.
